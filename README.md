Fire is a small tool developed to make it easy to kill process trees. All you need to do is select a window, press SHIFT+F4, and click "Yes".

### Why?
Fire was developed because of a small issue I had. Whenever I ALT+F4 an application, I would expect all subprocesses to die. In some applications, this is not the case. Sometimes, applications do not correctly clean up themselves when they are closed, which means that subprocesses can linger around longer than they should. Fire forcefully closes the parent process and all subprocesses, which is quite useful in the case of a program malfunctioning and spawning a lot of subprocesses.

### Downloads
